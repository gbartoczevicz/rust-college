# Rust College

This is a repository that aims to showcase some of Rust Lang's features. Some of the examples implemented here were inspired by the [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html) documentation.

## Requirements

If you have Docker installed I suggest opening this project in VSCode with the extension [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) installed, with it you're able to run this project inside a Docker container.

If you don't have Docker installed, I suggest installing the Rust toolchain with [Rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

This project uses:
- rustc 1.64.0
- cargo 1.64.0

## How to

After installing the requirements, you can run the project with

```bash
cargo run
```
